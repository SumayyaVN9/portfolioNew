      <h3>Hi Everyone,</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently pursuing a vocational degree in Software Application Development at CUSAT, 
        with an interest in full-stack development using the MERN stack. 
        I recently completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from 
         MES College, Marampally. My goal is to secure a respected position 
        in a reputed company and continue growing professionally in the field of 
         software development.
